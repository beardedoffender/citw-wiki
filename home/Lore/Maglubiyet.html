<p>In Faerun, Maglubiyet bullied several minor gods, taking them on as aspects and absorbing their followers. This is why goblinkind is so varied in appearance and ideology, but broadly tend to be crass bullies. Recently, Maglubiyet has been subsumed in turn by [[Bane]], making goblins an aspect of conquest and the defense of the universe.</p>
